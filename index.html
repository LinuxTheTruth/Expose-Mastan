  <h2>🚨 Scam Alert</h2>
  <p>Mastan Success Tuition looks professional on the outside but inside it's full of lies, favoritism, fake reviews, and overpriced classes. Students are ignored, teachers are rude, and many classes are rushed with zero care for learning.</p>

  <h2>🧠 What’s Really Happening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>RM200 per student for low-quality teaching</li>
    <li>Favoritism towards a few "chosen" students</li>
    <li>Fake reviews posted using bots or AI</li>
    <li>Teachers speak in Tamil/Arabic even when students don’t understand</li>
    <li>No proper help when students struggle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📢 What You Can Do</h2>

  <h2>🚗 Flashy Cars, Empty Classes</h2>
  <p>The owner spends time showing off cars on TikTok while students are left with low-quality education. Ask yourself – where is your money really going?</p>
