      <li>Teachers speaking languages not everyone understands</li>
      <li>No improvement, no help, no professionalism</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Owner‚Äôs Focus</h2>
    <p>The owner spends more time flexing cars on TikTok than fixing what's broken in his center. While students are left behind, your tuition fees are fuelling his lifestyle, not your education.</p>
